# RockPaperScissors

. Rock–paper–scissors (also known as scissors–rock–paper or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

. What are the rules of RPS?
Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:

## Rock wins against scissors.
## Scissors win against paper.
## Paper wins against rock.

### The Rock
The rock is internationally recognized by a closed fist where the thumb is not concealed.

### The Paper
Paper is delivered in the same way as the rock except that in this case all the fingers and the thumb are extended in a way that they all face the same direction.

### The Scissors
Scissors are thrown in the same way as rock where the hand is clenched into a fist but the index and the middle finger are extended to the front in order to make an angle that is of 30 to 45 degrees in a way that would resemble a pair of scissors.
